CLASS:: RedDiskInPlayer
SUMMARY:: simple GUI for soundfile playback from disk
CATEGORIES:: Red>redSampler
RELATED:: Classes/RedDiskInSampler, Overviews/redSampler

DESCRIPTION::
Uses link::Classes/RedDiskInSampler:: to stream soundfiles from disk. Use it to play back long soundfiles.

Drag and drop some soundfiles or a folder on the gui. Use ARROW keys to navigate and ENTER to play.

The GUI works as follows...
TABLE::
## vol || playback volume - (hold down CTRL key to reset)
## env || attack and release time in seconds
## bus || output bus index
## loop || keep repeating the soundfile. Note: not smooth because of file preloading
## folder || select a file to set path to all soundfiles. It is also possible to drag files and folders into the listview
## filter || 0 = all soundfiles, 1 = only mono files, 2 = stereo etc.
::

NOTE::
Soundfiles with sample rate that differ from the server's current samplerate will play back at wrong speed. This because of how link::Classes/DiskIn:: works.
